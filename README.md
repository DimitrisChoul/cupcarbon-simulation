# cupcarbon-simulation
This master thesisâ€™s project aims to study a specific problem in the scope of the Smart Cities, more specifically, 
the problem of intelligent management of parking in an urban environment. The objective is to improve the efficiency 
in the management of available vehicle spaces, providing a better experience to the users in the use and sharing of 
this often scarce resource. The CupCarbon simulation environment will be used for simulating and testing the proposed 
parking management scenarios.
